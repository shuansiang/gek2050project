                      Harry Potter has been one of the most popular book series of all time, which easily gained worldwide audiences to the blockbuster movies
                      and books. The author J.K. Rowling was extremely imaginative, to be able to build a fantasy-based theme but yet close to reality that we
                      can relate. The amount of details in the entire series was intricate and mind-blowing. It was indeed very impressive that she was able to
                      link all the books together, where every mystery has a deep reason and nothing goes unexplained.

                      Being a story filled with magic and love, I personally thought that it was interesting to do a textual analysis on the word frequency of the
                      locations, spells and character names. From this analysis, I hope to be able to draw a connection with each component and the nature of the
                      progression of the storyline towards the last book.

                      At one glance of this chart, we can easily observe that starting from the fourth book, the length of the stories get significantly
                      longer than the first three books. In fact, just by looking at the physical book size, this is an obvious observation.
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                      From my point of view, this could be attributed to the reason that Rowling can continue to introduce new and deep darker themes that 
                      the series was moving towards. Since the first three books did a wonderful job in establishing the context with solid foundations of 
                      the plot and characters, Rowling had the freedom to explore wildly and give us the mind-blowing twists and imagination in later books.
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                      There is also an increase in the number of unique words, which can suggest to us that as the plot thickens, the writing becomes more
                      sophisticated and there is a need to introduce new words to accomodate the enchating story. Since this is a fantasy-based story, 
                      it is natural that there will be new words that we have never heard of. Therefore, some of these new words could be character names,
                      locations, spells and items.

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                      There is also a sudden rise in the mentioning of the Ministry of Magic from the fourth book onwards. The peak was in the Order of 
                      the Phoenix where Ministry of Magic representative Umbridge takes over Hogwards, and this is the period where the Ministry of Magic 
                      is playing a huge involvement in the world of magic since the rebirth of Voldemort in the Goblet of Fire.

                      Grimmauld Place, the headquarters for the Order, was first introduced in the Order of the Phoenix and has been a place of importance
                      for hiding and planning against the Dark Lord's return.

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                      Azkaban was most often mentioned in the Prisoner of Azkaban and has been used very frequently for the rest of the books, as people are
                      constantly being sent in and breaking out of the prison.

                      It is clear from the chart that Expecto Patronum is the most casted spell across all the books. More particularly in the Prisoner of Azkaban,
                      which is not surprising due to the introduction of the Dementors, where the only spell that one can use to protect against them is the
                      Patronus Charm.

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                      We can also observe that the spell Accio was getting increasingly frequent from the fourth book onwards. Accio is the spell used to summon an
                      object at hand, which is really convenient to bring things towards you. In its usage regards to the plot, there is a trend that it has been used
                      in times of trouble and difficulty where a character needs to retrieve an object quickly. This can also tell us that the magical world has become
                      darker and more dangerous since Voldemort's ressurection in the Goblet of Fire, which give rise to a greater need and usage of this spell during
                      emergencies.

                      No one can forget the three Unforgivable Curses that made their way swiftly into the series starting from the Goblet of Fire. Their usage peaked
                      at the initial introduction but had a downward trend after that, before peaking again in the Deathly Hallows. The reason for the downward trend
                      could be due to the nature of the fifth and sixth book where it involves a lot of mystery, with very little battle action. However, the Deathly 
                      Hallows involved a lot of fighting and thus not surprising to see the excess usage of these curse spells, especially the killing spell Avada Kedavra.
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                      It can also be observed that the first three books were still relatively peaceful, where life in Hogwarts is safe and had happy endings. However,
                      since the introduction of curse spells from the fourth book onwards, we can draw a connection that the world becomes darker and dangerous since the
                      Dark Lord's return. This observation is parallel to the progression of the storyline.
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                      However, in most cases, casting of spells were not verbal (as seen from the movie adaption of the books). Therefore, the usage of these curse spells,
                      especially the killing spell, is used abundantly to kill without a thought.

                      Since Harry Potter is the main character of this series, it will be interesting to look at his relationship with other characters. This is made possible
                      using the 'Find Co-occuring Patterns' feature in TaporWare to find the occurrences of a specific character within five words, before and after the occurrence 
                      of Harry in the books.
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                      With Ron and Hermione as the main supporting characters to Harry Potter, it is no doubt that they will have the highest occurrence of being found in the
                      same text sentence as Harry. We can easily deduce that Harry has the strongest relationship with these characters.

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                      Another main character Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, also has a close relationship with Harry especially in the Half-Blood Prince where they
                      were on their mission to destory a Horcrux.
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                      This method of analysing relationships of characters is not very accurate because it does not take into account emotions and depth of conversation between
                      the characters. For example, even though Dumbledore does not appear often in the same text sentence as Harry, we all know that Dumbledore's role in the
                      story is very crucial and he has always been the key character in helping Harry overcome difficulties, and eventually destroying Voldemort. Therefore,
                      just by simply counting the co-occurence of other characters with Harry in the same text sentence, is not strong enough of a result to determine their
                      relationships.

                      The Harry Potter series is truly a rich and deep story with a vast variety of words that can be analysed in many different ways. The above analysis are
                      just some of the methods that we can use to study the books. However, the above analysis are enough to tell us that things start to go bad starting from 
                      the Goblet of Fire, which is the episode where Voldemort finally returns to rule the world with his dark magic and minions.

                      In future, textual analysis of the Harry Potter series may become more interesting with the recent introduction of the Fantastic Beasts series, which
                      sets itself decades before Harry Potter was born. Since only the first episode of this five saga series was released recently, there is still a lot of gaps
                      and holes that are difficult to fill and see the link to the Harry Potter series. Perhaps as the series unfold over the next few years, textual analysis will
                      have its glory in drawing connections between the two series in a literal aspect.
